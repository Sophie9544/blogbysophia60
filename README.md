**Cisco License Models and Smart Licensing**

Cisco License Models offer flexible ways for organizations to manage software and hardware licenses. They help businesses meet network and infrastructure requirements while keeping cost and compliance in check. One key model is [Cisco Smart License](https://golicense.net/product-category/cisco-license/smart-license/), which removes the need to manage individual license keys by automatically tracking usage and providing real time insights.


Other models include Cisco Software License Reservation (SLR) and Cisco Product License Reservation (PLR), which allow organizations to pre allocate licenses for software or devices, supporting better planning and immediate activation when needed. 
The Cisco Smart License Policy (SLP) provides a centralized, cloud based view of licensing status, making it easier to scale infrastructure while maintaining compliance.
